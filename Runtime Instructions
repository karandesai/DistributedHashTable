Instructions to run the DHT:

On the primary server side:

1. Edit the serv_id number to indicate the id of the current server where it is installed.

Eg:- If it is the first server to come up on the network , then value in the file should be 1. 
The numbers should be unique and in ascending order.

2. Edit the num_of_serv file to indicate the total number of primary servers on the network.

3. Edit the ahead_server file with the domain name of the next server to come up on the network:
Eg:- arkanoid.rutgers.edu

4. Edit the behind_server file with the domain name of the previous server to come up on the network.
Eg:- oxr.rutgers.edu

5. Edit the dht.h file on line 18 to indicate required keyspace

6. Compile the server program as follows:
g++ mult_serv.cpp -o mult_serv

7. Run the server program with any port no from 20000 to 65535 but it should be identical on all other servers and clients.

Eg: ./mult_serv 50000

On the secondary server side:

1. The serv_id file's contents must be the same as it's primary server.

2. Compile the sis_serv.cpp program:
g++ sis_serv.cpp -o sis_serv

3. ./sis_serv 50000




On the client side:

1. Compile the client side program
g++ client.cpp -o client

2. Run the client program 
Eg:- ./client 50000
